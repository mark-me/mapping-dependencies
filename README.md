# Mapping dependency parser

Builds insight in the network of entities and mappings by using RETW ouput files in order to determine:

* the ETL process has no loops (ETL should be acyclic),
* the ordering of mappings for the ETL orchestrator and
* the consequences when a step in ETL process fails.

## Mapping order

The ordering of mappings can be determined using ```mapping_order.py``` and changing the list with filenames in the ```main``` function's variable ```lst_files_RETW```. During this process the acyclic check is also performed.

### Output

Output generated by this script can be found in the files:

* ```output/dag_structure_*.html```, which shows the structure of the ETL, and
* ```output/mapping_order_*.jsonl``` which contains the ordering of the mapping executing which should be adopted by the orchestrator.

The asterisks in the filename indicates the iteration of each RETW file added to the network. This iterative output enables troubleshooting.

## ETL job failures

A simulation of a failure of ETL can be simulated using ```mapping_simulator.py```. The list with filenames in the ```main``` function's variable ```lst_files_RETW``` can be adjusted. In the same function you can 'simulate' an ETL-step failure by adjusting the variable ```id_entity_failed```; although the variable name suggests only entities can fail, you can also set this ID to a mapping.

### Output

Output generated by this script can be found in the files:

* ```output/dag_run_report.html```, which is a graphical representation of the failure consequences, and
* ```output/dag_run_fallout.json```, which reports on the mappings/entities affected by the failure.
